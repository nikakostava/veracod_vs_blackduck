### **On-Premises Deployment Availability**
- **Veracode**: Primarily a cloud-based SaaS platform, Veracode offers **limited on-premises deployment options**. Its core services (e.g., Static Analysis, Dynamic Analysis, SCA) are designed for cloud delivery, but certain components like the Veracode Software Composition Analysis (SCA) agent-based scanning CLI can be run on-premises or from a desktop. Full on-premises deployment for Veracode’s broader platform is not typically supported, as it emphasizes cloud infrastructure for scalability and ease of use. Some sources note that on-premises setups, when available, require substantial infrastructure investment and maintenance, which can be a drawback for agile teams.[](https://www.veracode.com/choose-veracode-over-black-duck/)[](https://www.veracode.com/choose-veracode-over-checkmarx/)
- **Black Duck**: Offers robust **on-premises deployment** options alongside hosted solutions. Black Duck is designed to support on-premises environments, particularly for its Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and Black Duck Binary Analysis (BDBA) capabilities. It’s well-suited for organizations needing local control over their security tools, especially for open-source risk management.[](https://research.aimultiple.com/sca-tools/)[](https://sig-synopsys.my.site.com/community/s/article/Black-Duck-A-Technical-Introduction)

**Key Takeaway**: Black Duck is the better choice for on-premises deployment, as it explicitly supports it with clear documentation. Veracode’s on-premises capabilities are limited, primarily confined to specific tools like the SCA CLI, and its platform is optimized for cloud use.
